# Business-Friendly Explanation of PathoptMatch

## What This App Does (In Simple Terms)

**PathoptMatch** is like having a super-smart assistant that instantly matches competitor products to your own inventory. Instead of spending hours manually cross-referencing competitor catalogs, invoices, and quotes, you simply upload a PDF and get instant matches to your products.

## The Business Problem It Solves

**Every sales team faces this challenge**: A competitor sends you their invoice or quote, and you need to figure out which of their products match your inventory so you can:
- Create competitive quotes
- Understand pricing gaps
- Identify product opportunities
- Respond to RFPs quickly
- Cross-sell equivalent products

**The old way**: Your sales reps spend hours manually looking up each competitor item, guessing which of your products might match, checking specifications, and often missing opportunities because it's too time-consuming.

**PathoptMatch's solution**: Upload the competitor's PDF → Get instant matches with confidence scores → Approve the good matches → Done.

## Key Business Benefits
