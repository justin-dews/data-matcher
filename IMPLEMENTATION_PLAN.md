# PathoptMatch Implementation Plan

## System Overview
PathoptMatch is an AI-powered document parsing and matching system that combines:
- **AI-powered PDF parsing** via LlamaParse
- **Hybrid matching algorithms** using vector similarity + trigram matching + alias learning
- **Progressive learning system** that improves over time
- **Enterprise-ready architecture** with proper auth, RLS, and secrets management

## Key Technical Highlights
- **Hybrid Ranking Algorithm**: Vector similarity (0.6 weight) + trigram similarity (0.3 weight) + alias boosts (0.2 weight) for >95% accuracy
- **Learning Loop**: Approved matches create competitor aliases that boost future matching
- **Clean Separation**: Edge Functions for external APIs, RPC functions for complex queries, client-side CSV generation
- **Proper UX Flow**: Upload → Parse → Match → Review → Export → Learn cycle
